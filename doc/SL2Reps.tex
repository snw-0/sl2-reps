 This package, \texttt{SL2Reps}, provides methods for constructing and testing matrix presentations of the
representations of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ whose kernels are congruence subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. 

 Irreducible representations of prime-power level are constructed individually
by using the Weil representations of quadratic modules, and from these a list
of all representations of a given degree or level can be produced. Each
representation is represented by a pair $(S,T)$, where $S$ is a symmetric, unitary matrix and $T$ is a diagonal matrix of finite order; this format is designed for the study of
modular tensor categories in particular.

 The group $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ is generated by $\mathfrak{s}$ = \texttt{[[0,1],[-1,0]]} and $\mathfrak{t}$ = \texttt{[[1,1],[0,1]]} (which satisfy the relations $\mathfrak{s}^4 = (\mathfrak{st})^3 = \mathrm{id}$). Thus, any complex representation $\rho$ of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ on $\mathbb{C}^n$ (where $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ is called the \emph{degree} or \emph{dimension} of $\rho$) is determined by the $n \times n$ matrices $S = \rho(\mathfrak{s})$ and $T = \rho(\mathfrak{t})$. 

 This package constructs irreducible representations of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ which factor through $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z})$ for some $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}^+$; the smallest such $\ell$ is called the \emph{level} of the representation, and is equal to the order of $T$. One may equivalently say that the kernel of the representation is a
congruence subgroup. Such representations are called \emph{congruent} representations. A congruent representation $\rho$ is called \emph{symmetric} if $S = \rho(\mathfrak{s})$ is a symmetric, unitary matrix and $T = \rho(\mathfrak{t})$ is a diagonal matrix; it was proved by the authors that every congruent
representation is equivalent to a symmetric one (see \ref{Chapter_Description_Section_Construction_Subsection_S_and_T_matrices}). Any representation of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ arising from a modular tensor category is symmetric \cite{DLN15}. 

 We therefore present representations in the form of a record \texttt{rec(S, T, degree, level, name)}, where the name follows the conventions of \cite{NW76}. 

 Note that our definition of $\mathfrak{s}$ follows that of \cite{Nobs1}; other authors prefer the inverse, i.e. $\mathfrak{s}$ = \texttt{[[0,-1],[1,0]]} (under which convention the relations are $\mathfrak{s}^4 = \mathrm{id}$, $(\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{t})^3 = \mathfrak{s}^2$). When working with that convention, one must invert the $S$ matrices output by this package. 

 Throughout, we denote by $\mathbf{e}$ the map $k \mapsto e^{2 \pi i k}$ (an isomorphism from $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ to the group of finite roots of unity in $\mathbb{C}$). For a group $G$, we denote by $\widehat{G}$ the character group $\operatorname{Hom}(G, \mathbb{C}^\times)$.

 Any representation $\rho$ of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ can be decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible representations (irreps).
Further, if $\rho$ has finite level, each irrep can be factorized into a tensor product of irreps
whose levels are powers of distinct primes (using the Chinese remainder
theorem). Therefore, to characterize all finite-dimensional representations of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ of finite level, it suffices to consider irreps of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}/p^\lambda\mathbb{Z})$ for primes $p$ and positive integers $\lambda$. 

 
\subsection{\textcolor{Chapter }{Weil representations}}\label{Chapter_Description_Section_Construction_Subsection_Weil_representations}
\logpage{[ 2, 1, 1 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X86466B2786DD47C4}{}
{
  

 Such representations may be constructed using Weil representations as
described in \cite[Section 1]{Nobs1}. We give a brief summary of the process here. First, if $M$ is any additive abelian group, a \emph{quadratic form} on $M$ is a map $Q : M \to \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ such that 
\begin{itemize}
\item $Q(-x) = Q(x)$ for all $x \in M$, and
\item $B(x,y) = Q(x+y) - Q(x) - Q(y)$ defines a $\mathbb{Z}$-bilinear map $M \times M \to \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$.
\end{itemize}
 

 Now let $p$ be a prime number and $\lambda \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. Choose a $\mathbb{Z}/p^\lambda\mathbb{Z}$-module $M$ and a quadratic form $Q$ on $M$ such that the pair $(M,Q)$ is of one of the three types described in Section \ref{Chapter_Description_Section_Weil}. Each such $M$ is a ring, and has at most 2 cyclic factors as an additive group. Those with 2
cyclic factors may be identified with a quotient of the quadratic integers,
giving a norm on $M$. Then the \emph{quadratic module} $(M,Q)$ gives rise to a representation of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}/p^\lambda\mathbb{Z})$ on the vector space $V = \mathbb{C}^M$ of complex-valued functions on $M$. This representation is denoted $W(M,Q)$. Note that the \emph{central charge} of $(M,Q)$ is given by $S_Q(-1) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{|M|}} \sum_{x \in M} \mathbf{e}(Q(x))$.

\subsection{\textcolor{Chapter }{Character subspaces and primitive characters}}\label{Chapter_Description_Section_Construction_Subsection_Character_subspaces_and_primitive_characters}
\logpage{[ 2, 1, 2 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X7A8505DA8318656E}{}
{
  

 A family of subrepresentations $W(M,Q,\chi)$ of $W(M,Q)$ may be constructed as follows. Denote 
\[\operatorname{Aut}(M,Q) = \{ \varepsilon \in \operatorname{Aut}(M) \mid
Q(\varepsilon x) = Q(x) \text{ for all } x \in M\}~.\]
 We then associate to $(M,Q)$ an abelian subgroup $\mathfrak{A} \leq \operatorname{Aut}(M,Q)$; the structure of this group depends on $(M,Q)$ and is described in Section \ref{Chapter_Description_Section_Weil}. Note that $\mathfrak{A}$ has at most two cyclic factors, whose generators we denote by $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Now, let $\chi \in \widehat{\mathfrak{A}}$ be a 1-dimensional representation (\emph{character}) of $\mathfrak{A}$, and define 
\[V_\chi = \{f \in V \mid f(\varepsilon x) = \chi(\varepsilon) f(x) \text{ for
all } x \in M \text{ and } \varepsilon \in \mathfrak{A}\}~,\]
 which is a $SL_2(\mathbb{Z}/p^\lambda\mathbb{Z})$-invariant subspace of $V$. We then denote by $W(M,Q,\chi)$ the subrepresentation of $W(M,Q)$ on $V_\chi$. Note that $W(M,Q,\chi) \cong W(M,Q,\overline{\chi})$. 

 For the abelian groups $\mathfrak{A} \leq \operatorname{Aut}(M,Q)$, we will frequently refer to a character $\chi \in \widehat{\mathfrak{A}}$ as being \emph{primitive}. With the exception of a single family of modules of type $R$ (the \emph{extremal} case, for which see Section \ref{Chapter_Description_Section_Weil_Subsection_Type_R_Special}), primitivity amounts to the following: there exists some $\varepsilon \in \mathfrak{A}$ such that $\chi(\varepsilon) \neq 1$ and $\varepsilon$ fixes the submodule $pM \subset M$ pointwise. There exists a subgroup $\mathfrak{A}_0 \leq \mathfrak{A}$ such that a non-trivial $\chi \in \widehat{\mathfrak{A}}$ is primitive if and only if $\chi$ is injective on $\mathfrak{A}_0$ (or, equivalently, if $\mathfrak{A}_0 \cap \operatorname{ker} \chi$ is trivial). 

 Explicit descriptions of the group $\mathfrak{A}_0$ for each type are given in Section \ref{Chapter_Description_Section_Weil} and may be used to determine the primitive characters.

{
  

 All irreps of prime-power level and finite degree may then be constructed in
one of three ways (\cite[Hauptsatz 2]{NW76}): 
\begin{itemize}
\item The overwhelming majority are of the form $W(M,Q,\chi)$ for $\chi$ primitive and $\chi^2 \neq 1$; we call these \emph{standard}. This includes the primitive characters from the extremal case.
\item A finite number, and a single infinite family arising from the extremal case
(Section \ref{Chapter_Description_Section_Weil_Subsection_Type_R_Special}), are instead constructed by using non-primitive characters or primitive
characters $\chi$ with $\chi^2 = 1$. We call these \emph{non-standard}.
\item Finally, 18 \emph{exceptional} irreps are constructed as tensor products of two irreps from the other two
cases. A full list of these may be constructed by \texttt{SL2IrrepsExceptional} (\ref{SL2IrrepsExceptional}).
\end{itemize}

{
  

 The images $W(M,Q)(\mathfrak{s})(f)$ and $W(M,Q)(\mathfrak{t})(f)$ may be calculated for any $f \in V$ (see \cite[Satz 2]{Nobs1}). Thus, to construct $S$ and $T$ matrices for the irreducible subrepresentations of $W(M,Q)$, it suffices to find bases for the $W(M,Q)$-invariant subspaces of $V$. Choices for such bases are given by \cite{NW76}; however, these often result in non-symmetric $S$ matrices. It has been proven by the authors of this package that, for all
standard and non-standard irreps, there exists a basis for the corresponding
subspace of $V$ such that $S$ is symmetric and unitary and $T$ is diagonal (\cite{NWWi}, in preparation). In particular, $S$ is always either a real matrix or $i$ times a real matrix. It follows that these properties hold for the exceptional
irreps as well. This package therefore produces matrices with these
properties. 

 All the finite-dimensional irreducible representations of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ of finite level can now be constructed by taking tensor products of these
prime-power irreps. Note that, if two representations are determined by pairs \texttt{[S1,T1]} and \texttt{[S2,T2]}, then the pair for their tensor product may be calculated via the GAP command \texttt{KroneckerProduct}, namely as \texttt{[KroneckerProduct(S1,S2),KroneckerProduct(T1,T2)]}.

 Let $p$ be prime. If $p=2$ or $p=3$, let $\lambda \geq 2$; otherwise, let $\lambda \geq 1$. Then the Weil representation arising from the quadratic module with 
\[M = \mathbb{Z}/p^\lambda\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/p^\lambda\mathbb{Z}
\qquad \text{and} \qquad Q(x,y) = \frac{xy}{p^\lambda}\]

 The group 
\[\mathfrak{A} \cong (\mathbb{Z}/p^\lambda\mathbb{Z})^\times\]
 acts on $M$ by $a(x,y) = (a^{-1}x, ay)$ and is thus identified with a subgroup of $\operatorname{Aut}(M,Q)$; see \cite[Section 2.1]{NW76}. The group $\mathfrak{A}$ has order $p^{\lambda-1}(p-1)$ and $\mathfrak{A} = \langle\alpha\rangle \times \langle\beta\rangle$. The relevant information for type $D$ quadratic modules is as follows: \begin{center}

 Let $p$ be prime and $\lambda \geq 1$. If $p \neq 2$, let $u$ be a positive integer so that $u \equiv 3$ mod 4 with $-u$ a quadratic non-residue mod $p$; if $p = 2$, let $u=3$. Then the Weil representation arising from the quadratic module with

 The additive group $M$ is a ring with multiplication given by

y_1y_2)\]

\[\mathfrak{A} = \{\varepsilon \in M^\times \mid \operatorname{Nm}(\varepsilon)
= 1 \}\]
 of $M^\times$ acts on $M$ by multiplication and is identified with a subgroup of $\operatorname{Aut}(M,Q)$; see \cite[Section 2.2]{NW76}. 

 The group $\mathfrak{A}$ has order $p^{\lambda-1}(p+1)$ and $\mathfrak{A} = \langle \alpha \rangle \times \langle \beta \rangle$. The relevant information for type $N$ quadratic modules is as follows: \begin{center}

 The structure of the quadratic module $(M,Q)$ of type $R$ depends upon three additional parameters: $\sigma$, $r$, and $t$. Details are as follows: 

 
\begin{itemize}
\item If $p$ is odd, let $\lambda \geq 2$, $\sigma \in \{1, \dots, \lambda\}$, and $r,t \in \{1,u\}$ with $u$ a quadratic non-residue mod $p$. Then define 
\[M = \mathbb{Z}/p^\lambda\mathbb{Z} \oplus
\mathbb{Z}/p^{\lambda-\sigma}\mathbb{Z} \qquad \text{and} \qquad Q(x,y) =
\frac{r(x^2 + p^\sigma t y^2)}{p^\lambda}~.\]
 When $\sigma = \lambda$, the second factor of $M$ is trivial, and $(M,Q)$ is said to be in the \emph{unary} family; otherwise, it is called \emph{generic}.
\item If $p=2$, let $\lambda \geq 2$, $\sigma \in \{0, \dots, \lambda-2\}$ and $r,t \in \{1,3,5,7\}$. Then define 
\[M = \mathbb{Z}/2^{\lambda-1}\mathbb{Z} \oplus
\mathbb{Z}/2^{\lambda-\sigma-1}\mathbb{Z} \qquad \text{and} \qquad Q(x,y) =
\frac{r(x^2 + 2^\sigma t y^2)}{2^\lambda}~.\]
 When $\sigma = \lambda - 2$, the second factor of $M$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, and $(M,Q)$ is said to be in the \emph{extremal} family; otherwise, it is called \emph{generic}.
\end{itemize}
 

 In all cases, the resulting representation is said to be of type $R$ and denoted $R(p,\lambda,\sigma,r,t)$. The additive group $M$ admits a ring structure with multiplication 
\[(x_1, y_1) \cdot (x_2, y_2) = (x_1x_2 - p^\sigma ty_1y_2, x_1y_2 + x_2y_1)\]
 and identity element $(1,0)$. We define a norm $\operatorname{Nm}(x,y) = x^2 + xy + p^\sigma t y^2$ on $M$. 

 In this section, we detail generic type $R$ quadratic modules. Information on the unary and extremal cases is covered in
Section \ref{Chapter_Description_Section_Weil_Subsection_Type_R_Special}. 

 Let $(M,Q)$ be a generic type $R$ quadratic module. Information on $(M,Q)$ can be obtained via \texttt{SL2ModuleR} (\ref{SL2ModuleR}), and subrepresentations of $R(p,\lambda,\sigma,r,t)$ with level $p^\lambda$ may be constructed via \texttt{SL2IrrepR} (\ref{SL2IrrepR}). 

 The multiplicative subgroup 
\[\mathfrak{A} = \{\varepsilon \in M^\times \mid \operatorname{Nm}(\varepsilon)
= 1 \}\]
 of $M^\times$ acts on $M$ by multiplication and is identified with a subgroup of $\operatorname{Aut}(M,Q)$; see \cite[Section 2.3 - 2.4]{NW76}. The relevant information is as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
\item If $p$ is odd, $\mathfrak{A} = \langle\alpha\rangle \times \langle\beta\rangle$ with order $2p^{\lambda-\sigma}$. In this case, for fixed $p$, $\lambda$, $\sigma$, each pair $(r,t)$ gives rise to a distinct quadratic module \cite[Satz 4]{Nobs1}. The following table covers a complete list of representatives of equivalence
classes of such modules. \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccccccc}$p$&

$\sigma$&

$r,t \in \{1,u\}$&
$|\alpha| = p^{\lambda-\sigma}$&
$(-1,0)$&
$\langle \alpha \rangle$\\
\end{tabular}\\[2mm]
\end{center}


\item If $p=2$, then the generic case occurs when $\lambda \geq 3$ and $\sigma \in \{0,\dots,\lambda-3\}$. Again, $\mathfrak{A} = \langle\alpha\rangle \times \langle\beta\rangle$; the order is $2^{\lambda-\sigma-k}$ with $k \in \{0,1,2\}$ (as specified below). In this case, for fixed $p$, $\lambda$, $\sigma$, two pairs $(r_1,t_1)$ and $(r_2,t_2)$ may give rise to equivalent quadratic modules \cite[Satz 4]{Nobs1}. The following table covers a complete list of representatives of equivalence
classes of such modules. \begin{center}

 This section covers the unary and extremal cases of type $R$. 

 First, in the unary family, we have $p$ odd and $\sigma = \lambda$. Then the second factor of $M$ is trivial (and hence $t$ is irrelevant). We then denote $R_{p^\lambda}(r) = R(p,\lambda,\lambda,r,t)$. In this case, we do not decompose $W(M,Q)$ using characters: instead, if $\lambda \leq 2$, then $W(M,Q)$ contains two distinct irreducible subrepresentations of level $p^\lambda$, denoted $R_{p^\lambda}(r)_{\pm}$; otherwise, it contains a single such subrepresentation, denoted $R_{p^\lambda}(r)_1$. The unary family is handled by \texttt{SL2IrrepRUnary} (\ref{SL2IrrepRUnary}) (which is called by \texttt{SL2IrrepR} (\ref{SL2IrrepR}) when appropriate). 

 Second, in the extremal family, we have $p=2$, $\lambda \geq 2$, and $\sigma = \lambda - 2$. Then the second factor of $M$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, and collapses in $2M$. Here, $\operatorname{Aut}(M,Q)$ is itself abelian, so we let $\mathfrak{A} = \operatorname{Aut}(M,Q)$. This group has order 1, 2, or 4, with the following structure: 
\begin{itemize}
\item For $\lambda = 2$ and $t=1$, $\mathfrak{A} = \langle \tau \rangle$ where $\tau : (x,y) \mapsto (y,x)$, and $\mathfrak{A}_0 = \mathfrak{A} = \langle\tau\rangle$.
\item For $\lambda = 2$ and $t = 3$, $\mathfrak{A}$ is trivial; there are no primitive characters.
\item For $\lambda = 3$ or $4$, $\mathfrak{A} = \{\pm 1\}$ acting on $M$ by multiplication; there are no primitive characters.
\item Finally, for $\lambda \geq 5$, $\mathfrak{A} = \operatorname{Aut}(M,Q) = \langle \alpha \rangle \times \langle
-1 \rangle$ with $\alpha$ of order 2, and $\mathfrak{A}_0 = \langle\alpha\rangle$. Note that, for this special case, the usual test for primitivity (described
in Section \ref{Chapter_Description_Section_Construction}) fails, as there are no elements of $\mathfrak{A}$ fixing $2M$ pointwise.
\end{itemize}
 The extremal family is handled by \texttt{SL2ModuleR} (\ref{SL2ModuleR}) and \texttt{SL2IrrepR} (\ref{SL2IrrepR}), just like the generic case.

 Methods for generating individual irreducible representations of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}/p^\lambda\mathbb{Z})$ for a given level $p^\lambda$. 

 After generating a representation $\rho$ by means of the bases in \cite{NW76}, we perform a change of basis that results in a symmetric representation
equivalent to $\rho$. 

 In each case (except the unary type $R$, for which see \texttt{SL2IrrepRUnary} (\ref{SL2IrrepRUnary})), the underlying module $M$ is of rank $2$, so its elements have the form $(x,y)$ and are thus represented by lists \texttt{[x,y]}. 

 Characters of the abelian group $\mathfrak{A} = \langle\alpha\rangle \times \langle\beta\rangle$ have the form $\chi_{i,j}$, given by 
\[\chi_{i,j}(\alpha^{v}\beta^{w}) \mapsto
\mathbf{e}\left(\frac{vi}{|\alpha|}\right)
\mathbf{e}\left(\frac{wj}{|\beta|}\right)~,\]
 where $i$ and $j$ are integers. We therefore represent each character by a list \texttt{[i,j]}. Note that in some cases $\alpha$ or $\beta$ is trivial, and the corresponding index $i$ or $j$ is therefore irrelevant. 

 We write \texttt{p=}$p$, \texttt{lambda=}$\lambda$, \texttt{sigma=}$\sigma$, and \texttt{chi=}$\chi$.

 Constructs and tests all non-trivial irreps of level dividing $p^\lambda$ by checking their positions in \texttt{Irr(G)} (see \href{https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/ref/chap71.html#X873B3CC57E9A5492} {Section 71.8-2 of the GAP Manual}). Note that this function will print information on the irreps involved if \texttt{InfoSL2Reps} is set to level 1 or higher; see Section \ref{Chapter_Introduction_Section_Usage}. }
